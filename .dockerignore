# Local data, if not meant to be in image (SQLite DB file itself should not be in image)
# data/*.db
# data/*.sqlite3
# (The data/ directory itself might be created by backend if it doesn't exist for SQLite,
# but the actual DB file should be managed by a volume or bind mount, not copied into image)
# Our docker-compose mounts ./data:/app/data, so the DB lives on the host.
